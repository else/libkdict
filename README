libdict README file

Libdict is a small library that intends to bring python-style
dictionaries to C. It provides various functions for dictionary
interaction like dict_get, dict_set etc.

Compilation instructions
========================

To compile libdict to a static library, simply run:
	make static
and you'll get a libdict.a.

Docs
====

For documentation on how to use libdict, see the doc directory. Also,
there's an example file which shows some of libdict's functions. It is
a good starting point to get an idea of how things work and can be found
in examples/example.c. To compile it, run:
	make example

P.S.: Yes, i know there are other libraries doing the same. The reasons
i still built my own one are:

 1. I needed it and didn't have internet at that point
 2. It had/has to work in Xelix
